      Reflection #1

    </h1>

In this week of learning, I learned about the design process. The design process is a process
wherein you have a certain problem that needs to be solved. The process includes the problem itself,
creating a solution/s, next would be analyzing the solutions and choosing what is best fitted for the
problem and most efficient way to solve the problem, next is embodying the solutions or simply
implement the solution, last would be assess, check for another incoming problems that needs to be
solved.
I have learned that the design process is a process that can be used on any situation. For
example, I have a problem about my money since I don’t have enough savings to buy materials for my
project. First, in order to solve that, of course I need the problem and the problem would be how to
save money to buy my needs. Next, I would generate some solutions, first solution would be I need to
save about 20 pesos per day and keep it in a safe and once the day has come that I need to buy my
needs, I have savings that I can spend with. But, the “generating solution” part of the process should not
just have one solution since if that solution won’t work, there would be a backup plan or a backup
solution. Another solution is to lessen my expenses. If I am eating too much since, I crave a lot for foods,
I will try to lessen my expenses in foods so I can have extra money to buy for the material that I needed.
Now that I have generated two solutions, I can now go to the next step of the process which is the
analyzing and choosing a solution that best fits the problem. Now, I think that the best solution would
be saving 20 pesos per day because this will be surely kept in a safe and it will be secured and used only
for future important purposes. Next step would be embodying the solution, I will now implement the
solution that I created and start saving 20 pesos per day. Next, assess, I would look for another problem
like if the 20 pesos is not enough to buy my needs, I would gather again some solutions that can help me
solve another problem.
The design process is quite helpful since it teaches us to solve a problem in an organize manner.
I learned that problems especially in programming and other school-related stuff can’t be easily solved
without a process. Design process would be a great help in addition to my knowledge because I can now
solve problems in school using a process. For me, using this process would help me lessen the thoughts
that comes up in my mind because there is a procedure that needs to be followed and my mind won’t
jump from a step to another step. Thoughts would not intersect with each other because there is a
process to follow.

In this week's topic, we learned more about forming a group, gathering problems and
designing the login interface of a mobile phone. Miss assigned a group leader and
Bryan picked me as his member. After that, we got zed and christian on our team. We
are now 4 on our team and we talked about different problems that we can solve and
feasible.
We first talked about what are we planning to solve. If we want to help lessen the
pollution in our environment, if we want ti lessen the crime rate in our country or if we
want to make people's time more efficient. Bryan suggested that we should help lessen
the pollution in the environment using his project proposal from our first term in our first
year. That project proposal is the trash bin wherein you can throw your trash but you
need to use a card to activate it. But since the scope is too big, we tried to focus on
problems within our school. The shuttle bus, the services and the cafeteria. Then, we
remembered our project from the second term in our first year which is the program that
can order from a restaurant. Now, we will implement it in a mobile phone so that
students have easy access to the application which will benefit them a lot since they will
not wait for the long line to be done before they can place their order. Our planned
project to do is we will create a mobile application wherein the students can order what
they want from the menu of XO Kitchen, Adryon's and Red Brew. Then after that, they
have the freedom to choose what time they are going to pickup the food. They can also
choose if they want to pay using the e-wallet system of the school or if they want to pay
right when they pick up the food. I think that this is efficient since students will save
more time for their lunch because they will not wait for the line in the cafeteria. Last
activity that we did is we presented our proposal and it is somehow good. After that,
miss gave us paper that has a blank screen of a mobile phone. We are now tasked to
create the login interface of our application. This is also hard for us since we don't really
know things about designing and stuff. But, zed has knowledge about it so he presented
himself that he will design the interface and we should give him ideas on the contents to
put in.
As a conclusion, we learned different things about this week's topic. We learned to
communicate more within our group, we brainstormed about the problems that is
currently happening in our community and we generated solutions to it. We also talked
about what is feasible and what is not. Lastly, I learned to contribute ideas so that we
can have many ideas to create better project.

      REFLECTION #3

I was into programming since when I was in Senior High School, but I think that HTML
is not considered a programming language. It is a markup language. I don’t really know what
that is. I thought that it will really be hard for me to create a web application since I don’t really
have a background about it, and I am starting from 0 knowledge.

I started doing it. Myself knows that my code for my web application is messy and not
easy to understand by others. Since I do not have a background about using HTML, I searched
for tutorials on the internet, but I am too lazy to watch tutorial videos from YouTube. I know that
watching tutorial videos would help me a lot, but I also know that it will take me a lot of time to
learn from it and I won’t really have much time to create my own web application. Then, I just
read from the internet specifically the tutorials from W3School. There are codes already written
for the beginners and it was helpful. Though I didn’t really read a lot of tutorials about what are
the attributes, what are the syntax and even how to import CSS file to html, something like that, I
did learn things about HTML just by looking at the codes given by W3School and testing the
output of the code. It was fun doing my own web application and I got the chance to design my
own website and add some features that I want. I added music since I really love music and my
girlfriend suggested it. What I really hated about doing the web application is that I was a bit
annoyed on positioning the elements. At first, I thought that my work is neat and was positioned
on the correct spot. But I tried sending the files to my girlfriend and when she opened the file,
the pictures were mixed up and the whole interface was messy. So, I did it from the start and
fixed everything, I was frustrated but the result was worthy.

In conclusion, it was fun doing my own web application since I got the freedom to put
whatever I want on my web application and I can do anything that I want. What will it look like,
what are the features, what can my website do and such. It was fun and at the same time
frustrating since I don’t have knowledge about HTML. But, I learned a lot and I am looking
forward to make my web application better.

Userinyerface – Worst UI Practice

This is a quiz, right? I was nervous that time because I didn’t review anything about the lesson,
and I thought that I will get low score or even a zero. But miss said that we shouldn’t get nervous and we
shouldn’t review anything because this quiz would be fun, and we would enjoy a lot. When I first read
the word “Userinyerface”, I thought of activities about designing an interface of a program. But then, I
was wrong.

It was a tricky puzzle game and we really had a hard time to continue to the next level. We tried
helping each other just to get out of a level. It was tricky because at first, we couldn’t find the close
button when the page says that it has been locked. I think that this is a lesson that I should remember
when I am designing an interface. I think that buttons should be put in a good position wherein the user
can see where to close a page or to go to the next page. Also, there is a part of the game wherein I can’t
exit the terms and condition and I must scroll down to the bottom of the terms and conditions page just
to exit that page. Maybe, the lesson that the puzzle is trying to imply is that I should have a better
interface since the use of interface is to have a better communication between the application and the
user. It was fun doing the puzzle, but I finished the puzzle at around 7 minutes, I think. I tried it for the
second time and since I already know what to do and what not to do, I finished it for 1 minute and 30
seconds. It was challenging because there are tricky parts and it was also fun since we helped each
other, and no one got stressed out playing the game.

As a conclusion, Userinyerface is a fun puzzle game and a meaningful game. Since the game
shows how bad can an interface be if the features/buttons will be placed in a bad position. The user will
tend to get confused when they use an application that has a bad interface since he or she might not
know what to do and how to access the application. All in all, I had fun playing that game and it boost
my competitive side so that I can finish the puzzle as fast as I could.
