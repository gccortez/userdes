In this week of learning, I learned about the design process. The design process is a process
wherein you have a certain problem that needs to be solved. The process includes the problem itself,
creating a solution/s, next would be analyzing the solutions and choosing what is best fitted for the
problem and most efficient way to solve the problem, next is embodying the solutions or simply
implement the solution, last would be assess, check for another incoming problems that needs to be
solved.
I have learned that the design process is a process that can be used on any situation. For
example, I have a problem about my money since I don’t have enough savings to buy materials for my
project. First, in order to solve that, of course I need the problem and the problem would be how to
save money to buy my needs. Next, I would generate some solutions, first solution would be I need to
save about 20 pesos per day and keep it in a safe and once the day has come that I need to buy my
needs, I have savings that I can spend with. But, the “generating solution” part of the process should not
just have one solution since if that solution won’t work, there would be a backup plan or a backup
solution. Another solution is to lessen my expenses. If I am eating too much since, I crave a lot for foods,
I will try to lessen my expenses in foods so I can have extra money to buy for the material that I needed.
Now that I have generated two solutions, I can now go to the next step of the process which is the
analyzing and choosing a solution that best fits the problem. Now, I think that the best solution would
be saving 20 pesos per day because this will be surely kept in a safe and it will be secured and used only
for future important purposes. Next step would be embodying the solution, I will now implement the
solution that I created and start saving 20 pesos per day. Next, assess, I would look for another problem
like if the 20 pesos is not enough to buy my needs, I would gather again some solutions that can help me
solve another problem.
The design process is quite helpful since it teaches us to solve a problem in an organize manner.
I learned that problems especially in programming and other school-related stuff can’t be easily solved
without a process. Design process would be a great help in addition to my knowledge because I can now
solve problems in school using a process. For me, using this process would help me lessen the thoughts
that comes up in my mind because there is a procedure that needs to be followed and my mind won’t
jump from a step to another step. Thoughts would not intersect with each other because there is a
process to follow.

In this week's topic, we learned more about forming a group, gathering problems and
designing the login interface of a mobile phone. Miss assigned a group leader and
Bryan picked me as his member. After that, we got zed and christian on our team. We
are now 4 on our team and we talked about different problems that we can solve and
feasible.
We first talked about what are we planning to solve. If we want to help lessen the
pollution in our environment, if we want ti lessen the crime rate in our country or if we
want to make people's time more efficient. Bryan suggested that we should help lessen
the pollution in the environment using his project proposal from our first term in our first
year. That project proposal is the trash bin wherein you can throw your trash but you
need to use a card to activate it. But since the scope is too big, we tried to focus on
problems within our school. The shuttle bus, the services and the cafeteria. Then, we
remembered our project from the second term in our first year which is the program that
can order from a restaurant. Now, we will implement it in a mobile phone so that
students have easy access to the application which will benefit them a lot since they will
not wait for the long line to be done before they can place their order. Our planned
project to do is we will create a mobile application wherein the students can order what
they want from the menu of XO Kitchen, Adryon's and Red Brew. Then after that, they
have the freedom to choose what time they are going to pickup the food. They can also
choose if they want to pay using the e-wallet system of the school or if they want to pay
right when they pick up the food. I think that this is efficient since students will save
more time for their lunch because they will not wait for the line in the cafeteria. Last
activity that we did is we presented our proposal and it is somehow good. After that,
miss gave us paper that has a blank screen of a mobile phone. We are now tasked to
create the login interface of our application. This is also hard for us since we don't really
know things about designing and stuff. But, zed has knowledge about it so he presented
himself that he will design the interface and we should give him ideas on the contents to
put in.
As a conclusion, we learned different things about this week's topic. We learned to
communicate more within our group, we brainstormed about the problems that is
currently happening in our community and we generated solutions to it. We also talked
about what is feasible and what is not. Lastly, I learned to contribute ideas so that we
can have many ideas to create better project.
