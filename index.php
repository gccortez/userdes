Hello! 

Gian is an 18-year old computer science student at Asia 
Pacific College. He lives at Villamor Air Base, Pasay City. 
He has 2 siblings and he is the middle child. He is a 
joyful person. Although he is not so friendly, but he is 
nice and caring . He used to love playing computer games, 
but he stopped because he wants to focus more on his studies.

During summer, Gian spends his free time reading the bible 
and playing piano. He has a bad habit of studying at school, 
last minute before a test. He procrastinates most of the time 
and crams his school works, yet he still manages to get good 
grades. He is not usually confident about his academic 
performance, regardless he still aims for progression and not 
perfection.

What makes Gian interesting?


Well, he resembles Grizz of We Bare Bears.

What Gian is expecting from this subject (USERDES) is that 
he will learn more about designing an interface of an 
application since it is needed for an easier interaction 
between the user and the program. He is also expecting that 
he will learn and have fun at the same time.
